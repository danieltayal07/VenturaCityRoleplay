# 🌃 Ventura City Roleplay — GTA V Roleplay Server  
### **An Open-Source GTA5 Roleplay Server**

---

## 🚀 Overview  
Ventura City Roleplay is an open-source GTA V Roleplay server built on **QBCore** using the **latest CFX artifacts**.  
This repository will serve as the foundation of the server, combining:

- My own custom development  
- Scripts built collaboratively with fellow developers  
- Purchased or licensed scripts  
- CFX-locked/encrypted components (stored separately, not included in the open-source repo)

My goal is to create a **stable, optimized, and feature-rich GTA RP experience**, while learning and mastering the tech stack required for serious FiveM development.

---

## 🧠 Why QBCore?  
I was initially skeptical about choosing **QBOX vs QBCore**, but for now, QBCore provides:

- Faster setup  
- Less hassle for initial development  
- A wide ecosystem of community resources  
- A stable, proven template to expand on  

> **Note:** QBOX development will continue in a private side repository.  
> The public build of Ventura City Roleplay will be QBCore-based.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
Ventura City Roleplay will use and explore:

- **QBCore Latest Template**  
- **Latest CFX Artifacts**  
- **Lua / JavaScript / TypeScript**  
- **Node.js + Express (API services)**  
- **React / Next.js (Dashboard & Admin Panel)**  
- **MySQL (oxmysql / ghmattimysql)**  
- **NUI (HTML / CSS / JS)**  
- **Custom gameplay systems, logic, and interaction flows**

I currently have basic to intermediate knowledge of the above technologies and aim to deepen my expertise during this project.
